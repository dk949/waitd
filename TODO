Interface:
    General idea:
        Being bale to supply the name of the program/script to be executed when no input has been received.
        Or the program to be executed when the input has finally been received.
        Or both.
        A help and/or usage message.
    Nice to have:
        How long to do it for
        How many times to do it
        Until what time to do it.

    Implementation:
        -e EXECUTABLE or --exec-on-wait=EXECUTABLE
        -E EXECUTABLE or --exec-on-resume=EXECUTABLE
        -h or --help
